# wTher

Minimalistic world forecast application built with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

You can see the running application [here](https://alxpez.github.io/wther/).
Notice that API calls are reverse-proxied through [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere),
so just have in mind that requests/responses may take a bit longer.


### API's

- **google-places-api** (for predictive city search)
- **openweathermap-api** (to retrieve forecast information).
