# wTher

Minimalistic world forecast application built with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

You can see the running application [here](https://al-pez.github.io/wther/).
Notice that API calls are made through [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere),

>_a reverse proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied requests_

so just have in mind that requests/responses may take a bit longer.


## API's

- **google-places-api** (for predictive city search)
- **openweathermap-api** (to retrieve forecast information).
